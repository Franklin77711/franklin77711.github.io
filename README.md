----------Trophy Library Application----------

In this project I have made a simple Library app. 
You can add games, 
    -   the name must be unique can't be more the one of the same name
    -   you can add playtime, there is not limitation to it
    -   you can add difficulty, that must be between 0 and 10
    -   there is a switch that indicates that you have platinumed it or not

After you have succesfully added a game you can edit it, with the three dot at the right upper corner.
You can then change the values of the current game (you still must use unique name you can't change to an existing one) or you can delete the game.
After the page refresh your added games will still be there, the array of objects is saved in your localstorage.

----Future ideas----

cleaner code
dark/light mode
platinum switch value save
